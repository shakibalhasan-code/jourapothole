# JouraPothole - Road Defect Reporting App

## Project Description

**JouraPothole** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to enhance road safety by allowing users to report and share information about road defects, such as potholes, crashes, or damaged sections. Imagine driving down a road and spotting a hazardous pothole—through JouraPothole, you can quickly report it with details like location and severity. Other drivers using the app will then receive real-time awareness of these defects, helping them navigate safely and avoid potential accidents. Built with scalability and maintainability in mind, this app leverages GetX for state management, ScreenUtils for responsive design, and Flutter’s localization for multi-language support, making it accessible to a global audience.

Key features:
- **Report Defects**: Users can log road issues with descriptions and locations.
- **Real-Time Awareness**: Other drivers see reported defects to stay cautious.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Feature-first approach for easy expansion (e 
   
.g., adding maps, user profiles).
- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish) for broader reach.

This project aims to empower communities to improve road safety collaboratively.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed (version 2.18.0 or higher recommended). Run `flutter doctor` to verify your setup.
- **Dart**: Comes with Flutter, no separate installation needed.
- **IDE**: VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter plugins.
- **Device/Emulator**: An Android/iOS emulator or physical device.

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jourapothole.git
   cd jourapothole
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate Localization Files**:
   ```bash
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```
   - This generates `import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';` from `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/`.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   - Launches the app on your connected device or emulator.
   - Use `flutter run -d <device-id>` to specify a device if multiple are connected (find device IDs with `flutter devices`).

5. **Clean Build (Optional)**:
   If you encounter issues, clean the project and rebuild:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter gen-l10n
   flutter run
   ```

## Locale Setup Commands

JouraPothole supports multiple languages (English and Spanish by default) using Flutter’s built-in localization system. Here’s how to set it up:

### Requirements
- `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/` (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`).
- `intl: ^0.19.0` in `pubspec.yaml`.
- `flutter: generate: true` in `pubspec.yaml`.

### Commands
1. **Generate Localization Files**:
   ```bash
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```
   - Creates `package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart` with `AppLocalizations` class.
   - Run this whenever you update `.arb` files.

2. **Verbose Mode (Debugging)**:
   ```bash
   flutter gen-l10n -v
   ```
   - Provides detailed output to troubleshoot issues.

3. **Switch Locale in App**:
   - The app defaults to English (`Locale('en')`) in `main.dart`.
   - Use the "Switch to Spanish" button in `HomeView` to test Spanish (`Get.updateLocale(const Locale('es'))`).

### Example `.arb` Files
- **`lib/l10n/app_en.arb`**:
  ```json
  {
    "homeTitle": "Home",
    "welcomeMessage": "Welcome to JouraPothole!",
    "count": "Reported Defects: {value}",
    "increment": "Report Defect",
    "@count": {
      "placeholders": {
        "value": {
          "type": "String"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **`lib/l10n/app_es.arb`**:
  ```json
  {
    "homeTitle": "Inicio",
    "welcomeMessage": "¡Bienvenido a JouraPothole!",
    "count": "Defectos Reportados: {value}",
    "increment": "Reportar Defecto",
    "@count": {
      "placeholders": {
        "value": {
          "type": "String"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
